        <h1>Privacy Policy for Splitter</h1>
        <p class="last-updated"><strong>Last Updated:</strong> January 16, 2026</p>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Splitter ("we," "our," or "the app") is a local-first expense splitting application. This Privacy Policy explains what information is collected by the app and our third-party services when you use Splitter.</p>

        <h2>Information We Collect</h2>

        <h3>Data Stored Locally on Your Device</h3>
        <p>All expense data, group information, and settlements you create in Splitter are stored <strong>locally on your device only</strong>. This includes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Expense details (amounts, descriptions, dates)</li>
            <li>Group member names</li>
            <li>Settlement calculations</li>
            <li>App preferences and settings</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="important"><strong>Your expense content stays on your device. We do not upload individual expense titles, descriptions, or participant names.</strong></p>
        <h3>Information Collected by Third-Party Services</h3>
        <p>We use third-party services to display ads, understand app usage, and improve stability: Google AdMob (ads), Google Firebase Analytics (usage and engagement metrics), and Sentry (crash/error reporting). These services may collect device information (model, OS version), app version, IP address, advertising identifiers, and basic interaction or diagnostic data. For analytics, we may send pseudonymous identifiers (such as a group ID) and aggregate values like total expense amounts, payers/participants counts, and screen views. We do not send expense titles, descriptions, or participant names to these services.</p>
        <p>Learn more: <a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy" target="_blank">Firebase Privacy and Security</a>, <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google Privacy Policy</a>, <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites" target="_blank">Google partner services</a>, <a href="https://sentry.io/privacy/" target="_blank">Sentry Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

        <h3>Advertising Preferences and Consent</h3>
        <p>Depending on your region, you may see a consent dialog that lets you choose personalized or non-personalized ads. You can change this anytime in <strong>Settings &rarr; Ad Preferences</strong>.</p>
        <p><strong>iOS 14.5+:</strong> If you allow personalized ads, you may also see Apple's App Tracking Transparency prompt.</p>
        <p>You can opt out of personalized advertising through your device settings:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>iOS:</strong> Settings &gt; Privacy &amp; Security &gt; Tracking</li>
            <li><strong>Android:</strong> Settings &gt; Google &gt; Ads &gt; Opt out of Ads Personalization</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Data Retention</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Local Data:</strong> Stored on your device until you delete the app or clear app data.</li>
            <li><strong>Analytics Data:</strong> Retained by Google Firebase according to their retention policies (typically 14 months, configurable).</li>
            <li><strong>Error Logs:</strong> Retained by Sentry according to their retention policies (typically 90 days).</li>
            <li><strong>Advertising Data:</strong> Retained by Google AdMob according to their policies.</li>
            <li><strong>Ad consent:</strong> Stored locally until reset or app data is cleared.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Your Rights</h2>
        <p>You have the right to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Delete all local data by uninstalling the app or clearing app data</li>
            <li>Opt out of personalized advertising in Settings &rarr; Ad Preferences or through device settings</li>
            <li>Request information about what analytics or error data has been collected (contact us at the email below)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>Our app does not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. The app is not directed to children under 13.</p>

        <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy. Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.</p>
